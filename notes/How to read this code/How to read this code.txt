The majority of the game's code is in the obj_roomgrid and obj_mapgrid objects.
These objects are what the player clicks on when they click a space in the editable area.
Depending on what menu buttons are selected the result will be different, but it usually creates an object.

In the room editor, the majority of the code is in obj_block, which acts as a parent for most other objects.
